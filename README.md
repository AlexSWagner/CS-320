# Portfolio Submission for Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance

## Overview
This repository showcases my work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance, as demonstrated in the projects completed during my coursework. It includes a portion of my work from two major projects: the Contact Service from Project One and the Summary and Reflections report from Project Two. These files demonstrate my ability to create unit tests, uncover errors, and apply various software testing strategies to meet specific requirements.

### Files Included
- **Contact Service Files:**
  - `Contact.java`
  - `ContactService.java`
  - `ContactTest.java`
  - `ContactServiceTest.java`
- **Summary and Reflections Report:**
  - `Project 2 Summary and Reflections Report.docx`

## Reflection

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that my code is both functional and secure, I adopt a comprehensive testing approach that includes unit testing, boundary value analysis, and equivalence partitioning. By covering a wide range of scenarios, I can identify potential issues early in the development process. I also follow industry best practices such as validating inputs, handling exceptions properly, and using secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities. For example, in the `ContactService` project, I created unit tests to validate that the `Contact` class handled constraints such as string length limits and proper phone number formatting, ensuring that the data integrity is maintained.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs involves careful analysis of the requirements provided by the client or end-user. I ensure that I fully understand the constraints and expectations before beginning the development process. This involves creating user stories, mapping out the functional requirements, and then translating those into code. In the `ContactService` project, I focused on creating a system that met all the specified constraints, such as unique contact IDs and proper data validation, ensuring that the software met the user's expectations.

### How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software involves a structured process of requirement analysis, system design, and iterative testing. I start by breaking down the requirements into smaller, manageable components and then design each component with modularity and reusability in mind. For instance, in the `ContactService`, I designed the service layer to be independent of the underlying data structure, allowing for easier modifications and scalability in the future. I also incorporate best practices such as clear naming conventions, code documentation, and adherence to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to ensure the software is maintainable and easy to understand.
